# Crypto Trading Risk Management System

## Overview
This repository hosts the source code for a comprehensive Crypto Trading Risk Management System designed to automate and optimize cryptocurrency trading by applying advanced risk management strategies and trading algorithms. The system uses a variety of scripts to perform technical analysis, fundamental analysis, market sentiment analysis, and to manage trades based on pre-defined risk parameters.

## Features
- **Technical Analysis**: Utilize scripts to calculate moving averages, RSI, and MACD for various cryptocurrencies.
- **Fundamental Analysis**: Analyze earnings reports and regulatory changes that could impact cryptocurrency values.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Gather and analyze sentiment from social media and news sources to gauge market sentiment.
- **Trading Automation**: Automatically execute trades based on analyzed data and user approvals through intuitive notifications.
- **Risk Management**: Ensure that no trade exceeds the set risk threshold of the total portfolio, with dynamic adjustments based on real-time account valuation.
